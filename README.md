--> Greetings, my name is Aivaras and right now I'm first year student of Computer Science at Klaipėdos Valstybinė Kolegija in Lithuania. <--

Eventhough I don't a lot of knowledge yet regarding programming, I'm passionate about learning and improving.
<br>Right now I've got fundamentals of :
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JS</li>
</ul>
Currently trying to apply that knowledge by learning to use and create with React. 
<br>Next stop on my roadmap is Java and Node.js.

We all have hobbies so do I, besides learning, I'm passionate about :cook: and riding :bicyclist:. 
If you have your special recipe you'd like me to try or wanted to discuss something regarding bicycles, feel free to contact me. :sunglasses:@
